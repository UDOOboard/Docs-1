Porting Volumio to new Platforms
################################


Here you'll find the standard procedure I'll follow to port Volumio on newer Platforms. I designed Volumio's filesystem
to be easily adapted to various ArmHF capable platforms, this was initially time consuming, but it payed in the long run, 
as a new porting will require a limited amount of time.
I won't cover here the process of creating Volumio's rootfs. I will write about that in the future.
