Compiling MPD
############


Volumio uses a custom compiled Version of MPD ( http://musicpd.org ). A lightweight, powerful and brilliant Music Player Daemon
(you don't say...).

Using a compiled version brings some advantages over Debian mantained packages:

- Better performances both in term of responsiveness, and in system load (especially useful in low power platforms like the PI)
- Avoidance of unpredicted bugs, which can affect user experience
- Custom patching, that allows to add extra functionalities (not used in Volumio)
- The fun of compiling something

Volumio (from 1.3beta) uses MPD 18.9
